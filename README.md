These two activities are indicated from age 12.  The purpose is to introduce the concepts of encryption, steganography, security and privacy.

The first is Cipher Fun Wheel, a playful activity where groups of 3-4 people participate. A situation will be created – from a story the participants will made up - in which 1 participant writes an encrypted message using the cipher wheel and conceals its content (steganography), the recipient and 1 or 2 others attempt to intercept and decode a message.

The goal in the "Cipher Fun Wheel" is to introduce the participants in cryptography and steganography.  They will understand how hard it is to break down strong encryption in addition to discovering that a message is concealed.

Once they understand how encryption work in the offline world, it's time to teach how to create strong and easy-to-remember passwords using cryptographic keys with the Diceware method to use online.   Also, it is very important at this moment provide tips about HTTPS and 2-factor authentication.



**How to play CIPHER FUN WHEEL**

- Read **[Cipher Fun Wheel pdf](https://github.com/cyb3113/CryptoMadness/files/1136297/CIPHER.FUN.WHEEL.pdf)**

- Print the **[cipher-fun-wheel-template.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19938761/28027799-d2ce7e08-6570-11e7-8624-91b89e386f16.png)**, cut and join the wheel;

- Or if you feel audacious, you can remix and print the **[cipher-fun-wheel-freedom-template.svg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19938761/28027800-d3d3d226-6570-11e7-86c4-f2f351955cc2.png)** as you want.


**How to create strong, safe and easy to remember passphrases using the CRAZY DICEWARE**

- Read and use the **[CRAZY DICEWARE booklet](https://github.com/cyb3113/venus/files/1129427/crazy-diceware-booklet.pdf)**

**NOTE 1:** 

Hi, this the first time I contribute to  Mozilla Global Sprint.  In fact, I joined as Mozilla volunteer recently.

I'm an enthusiast of cryptography, privacy and safety on web. For a couple of years I'm volunteer in a big crypto party, this encouraged me to contribute with this project.

In the **Cipher Fun Wheel** I used some math symbols, prime numbers, letter and unicode emojis. My main inspiration  is the cipher mexican wheel. In the **Crazy Diceware**, I adapted from ThoughtWorks Dadoware and the wordlist from Eletronic Frontier Foundation


To write te text I used the Zilla font.

I hope you enjoy it and develop more intricate ciphers.

**NOTE 2:** 

Since English is not my mother language, the following text may have grammar errors and be a little weird sometimes.  However, since this is an open project I’m very happy to hear comments, suggestions, critics… 

The main purpose of this project is to teach - I suggest the mentoring in a playful way, creating stories, introducing concepts in a very simple way. In any case, it can be reshaped to different target audiences - the importance of privacy and safety,  and to introduce cryptography, to later encourage people to use modern cryptography/ stenography and better privacy customs. 

This is a multidisciplinary project, along with the techniques of cryptography/ steganography, privacy, and safety, can be used to teach history, math, literature, geography…

**MOZILA GLOBAL SPRINT 2017**

This project was developed for the Mozilla Privacy Arcade Offline Games Challenge, which is part of Mozilla Global Sprint that took place on June 1-2, 2017, we met personally on sites around the world and online to collaborate on this project and learn with each other.
