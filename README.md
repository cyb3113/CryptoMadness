**NOTE 1:** 

Hi, this the first time I contribute to  Mozilla Global Sprint.  In fact, I joined as Mozilla volunteer recently.

I'm an enthusiast of cryptography, privacy and safety on web.  Despite I know so little, I want to help others to understand how important and fundamental is to know how to be protected and safe on internet.  For a couple of years I'm volunteer in a big crypto party, this encouraged me to contribute with this project.

In this cipher wheel I used some math symbols, prime numbers, letter and unicode emojis. My main inspiration for my wheel is the Cipher Mexican Wheel. 

To write te text I used the Zilla font.

I hope you enjoy it and develop more intricate ciphers.

**NOTE 2:** 

Since English is not my mother language, the following text may have grammar errors and be a little weird sometimes.  However, since this is an open project I’m very happy to hear comments, suggestions, critics… 

The main purpose of this project is to teach - I suggest the mentoring in a playful way, creating stories, introducing concepts in a very simple way. In any case, it can be reshaped to different target audiences - the importance of privacy and safety,  and to introduce cryptography, to later encourage people to use modern cryptography/ stenography and better privacy customs. 

This is a multidisciplinary project, along with the techniques of cryptography/ steganography, privacy, and safety, can be used to teach history, math, literature, geography…

**NOTE 3:** 

I am proposing two activities, that are indicated to participants from the age of 12.

The first, **Cipher Fun Wheel**, a amusing activity where groups of 3-4 people will participate. A situation will be created in which 1 participant will write an encrypted message using the cipher wheel and hide its contents (steganography), the receiver and 1 or 2 others will try to intercept and decode the message.

A possible situation may be a spy (whom writes the message), the ally (who receives the message) and 2 enemies who will try to intercept and decipher the message. However, the story can be adapted according to the participants.

The purpose is introduce and stimulat the understanding of  how hard it is to break down strong encryption and  the benefits of concealing a important message, and so important as this, is how essential the privacy is.

The second activity, complementing the Cipher Fun Wheel, is learning how to create Passphrases (a very strong password!) using **Diceware** technique.

**How to play**

- Print the **cipher-fun-wheel-template.png**, cut and join the wheel;

- Or if you feel audacious, you can print the **cipher-fun-wheel-freedom-template.svg** and remix as you want.

**MOZILA GLOBAL SPRINT 2017**

This project was developed for the Mozilla Privacy Arcade Offline Games Challenge, which is part of Mozilla Global Sprint that took place on June 1-2, 2017, we met personally on sites around the world and online to collaborate on this project and learn with each other.
