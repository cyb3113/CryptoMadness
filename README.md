**NOTE 1:** Hi, this the first time I contribute to  Mozilla Global Sprint.  In fact, I joined as Mozilla volunteer recently.

I'm an enthusiast of cryptography, despite I know so little, but look forward to learn. For a couple of years I'm also volunteer in a large crypto party.  This encouraged me to contribute with this project.

In this cipher wheel I used some math symbols, prime numbers, letter and unicode emojis. My main inspiration for my wheel was the Cipher Mexican Wheel. 

To write te text I used the Zilla font.

I hope you enjoy it and develop more intricate ciphers.

**NOTE 2:** Since English is not my mother language, the following text may have grammar errors and be a little weird sometimes.  However, since this is an open project I’m very happy to hear comments, suggestions, critics… 

The main purpose of this project is to teach - I suggest the mentoring in a playful way, creating stories, introducing concepts in a very simple way. In any case, it can be reshaped to different target audiences - the importance of privacy and to introduce cryptography, to later encourage people to use modern cryptography/ stenography and better privacy customs. 
This is a multidisciplinary project, can be used in teaching history, math, literature, geography…

**MOZILA GLOBAL SPRINT 2017**

This project was developed for the Mozilla Privacy Arcade Offline Games Challenge, which is part of Mozilla Global Sprint that took place on June 1-2, 2017, we met personally on sites around the world and online to collaborate on this project and learn with each other.
